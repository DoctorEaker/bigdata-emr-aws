# bigdata-emr-aws

## Introduction

This is a project for the course ST0263 (Special Topics in Telematics) at EAFIT University, in this project we'll provide evidence for the work done in the labs for Unit 3 of the course that focuses on big data.

## Table of contents

## Goals
 - Learn how to deploy an EMR Cluster in AWS
 - Learn how to manage datasets and files for the EMR
 - Learn how to persist the data in EMR using S3 Buckets

## Requirements
 - An AWS Account
 - Basic understanding on how the AWS interface works
 - Understandin on how to connect via SSH

## Project Structure
 The project is organized in a way that you can follow along, the first part focuses on how to deploy the EMR Cluster in AWS, then we'll focus on how to enable HUE and the different ways that we can manage files, finally since the instances are terminated, all data will be lost, so to persist the data we'll make use of an AWS S3 Bucket
